# R.I.K.[Robot-Interactive-K-9]
Something big is built in small steps

This is the repository for R.I.K.
The goal is to collaborate between members to make a quadruped dog robot autonomous. 
This is a system for members with basic knowledge in C++, C & Java 

Working on the Instructions tab, Started to document the building & programming process.
